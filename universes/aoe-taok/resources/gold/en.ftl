gold-description =
    Gold has been inexplicably valuable to people, ever since it was first discovered. In the middle
    ages, the peasants would be forced to mine the gold and then hand it over to the nobles who
    controlled all the wealth, and only gave the smallest amounts to the peasants for their hard
    work.
