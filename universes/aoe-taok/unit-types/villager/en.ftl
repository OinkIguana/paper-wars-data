villager-description =
    The great percentage of people in the Middle Ages were peasants, serfs, and lowly villagers who
    gathered the food and did most of the work. They supported a relatively small class of religious
    leaders and noblemen who controlled the wealth and power of the community. The life of the
    peasant and serf was hard but improved as feudalism gave way to social systems that allowed the
    workers to retain more of their produce. Many peasants moved into the middle class of the
    growing cities. Those who remained on the farms saw their production and wealth increase thanks
    to specialization and many technological improvements in agriculture.
