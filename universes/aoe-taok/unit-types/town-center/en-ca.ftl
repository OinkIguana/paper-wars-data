town-center-description =
    All villages and towns had an administrative centre that was the seat of governmental power and
    leadership. During the Dark Ages this might have been the local leader's home. Later it might
    have been the town hall or local lord's manor house. The town centre was often the place where
    supplies were stored, especially food supplies. The destruction of the town centre usually meant
    the loss of the town's governmental infrastructure. If this could not be restored, the town or
    village ceased to function.
